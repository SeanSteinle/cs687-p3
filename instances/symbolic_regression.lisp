;;; SYMBOLIC REGRESSION
;;; This problem domain is similar, more or less, to the GP example in
;;; the lecture notes.  Your goal is to make a symbolic expression which
;;; represents a mathematical function consisting of SIN COS, EXP,
;;; +, -, *, and % (a version of / which doesn't give an error on
;;; divide-by-zero).  And also the function X, which returns a current
;;; value for the X variable.
;;;
;;; In symbolic regression, we generate 20 (x,y) pairs produced at
;;; random which fit the expression y = x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x.  You can
;;; make up another function is you like, but that's the one we're going
;;; with here.  Using just these data pairs, the GP system will attempt
;;; to ascertain the function.  It will generate possible expressions
;;; as its individuals, and the fitness of an expression is how closely,
;;; for each X value, it gives the correct corresponding Y value.
;;;
;;; This is called SYMBOLIC regression because we're actually learning
;;; the mathematical expression itself, including transcendental functions
;;; like SIN and COS and E^.  As opposed to statistical linear or
;;; quadratic curve-fitting regressions which just try to learn the
;;; linear or quadratic parameters etc.
;;;
;;; An example 100% optimal solution:
;;;
;;; (+ (* (x) (* (+ (x) (* (x) (x))) (x))) (* (+ (x) (cos (- (x) (x)))) (x)))



;;; GP SYMBOLIC REGRESSION SETUP
;;; (I provide this for you)

(defparameter *num-vals* 20)
(defparameter *vals* nil) ;; gets set in gp-setup

(defun gp-symbolic-regression-setup ()
  "Defines the function sets, and sets up vals"

  (setq *nonterminal-set* '((+ 2) (- 2) (* 2) (% 2) (sin 1) (cos 1) (exp 1)))
  (setq *terminal-set* '(x))

  (setq *vals* nil)
  (dotimes (v *num-vals*)
    (push (1- (random 2.0)) *vals*)))

(defun poly-to-learn (x) (+ (* x x x x) (* x x x) (* x x) x))
;to get Y: (mapcar #'poly-to-learn *vals*)
;to get Y_hat: ()

;; define the function set
(defparameter *x* nil) ;; to be set in gp-evaluator
(defun x () *x*)
(defun % (x y) (if (= y 0) 0 (/ x y)))  ;; "protected division"
;;; the rest of the functions are standard Lisp functions


;;; GP SYMBOLIC REGRESSION EVALUATION
(defun evaluate-tree (tree)
  "Helper for symbolic-regression-evaluator. Evaluates the given tree using the current value of *x*."
  (cond
    ((numberp tree) tree)  ; If it's a number, return it
    ((symbolp tree) (funcall tree))  ; If it's a symbol, call the corresponding function
    ((listp tree)  ; If it's a list, evaluate it as a function application
     (let ((op (car tree))
           (args (cdr tree)))
       (apply (symbol-function op) (mapcar #'evaluate-tree args))))
    (t (error "Unknown tree element: ~a" tree))))


(defun gp-symbolic-regression-evaluator (ind)
  (declare (ignore ind))
  "Evaluates an individual by setting *x* to each of the
elements in *vals* in turn, then running the individual and
get the output minus (poly-to-learn *x*).  Take the
absolute value of the this difference.  The sum of all such
absolute values over all *vals* is the 'raw-fitness' Z.  From
this we compute the individual's fitness as 1 / (1 + z) -- thus
large values of Z are low fitness.  Return the final
individual's fitness.  During evaluation, the expressions
evaluated may overflow or underflow, or produce NaN.  Handle all
such math errors by
returning most-positive-fixnum as the output of that expression."
